Alias is an Elder Scrolls Online addon which allows you to create and save console commands which are aliases to other console commands, a simple idea with meaningful implications.

Alias can be used to:
- Shorten commonly used commands: `/alias add rui reloadui`
- Save commonly used command parameters: `/alias add ls loot show`
- Create entirely new commands: `/alias add test script d("Success!")`
- Alias client commands, commands added by other addons, even non-existent commands.
- Register and unregister game events.
 

Alias can *not* be used to:
- Automatically send chat messages - **this is a limitation imposed by the game client**.
 

## Features
- Aliases are saved account-wide, making them available to all characters.
- Aliases are restored each time you play.
- Aliases can be set to automatically execute on player load.
